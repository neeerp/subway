# Random Subway Station Exploration

This is a simple webpage hosted on AWS Lambda using go templ + HTMX. It suggests a random subway station to explore in Toronto!

## Build Instructions
Run `./bundle.sh` and then manually upload the individual lambdas to AWS like the primitive you are.

## TODO List
[ ] Automate deployment to AWS so I don't have to manually upload this stuff every time I make a change
[ ] Use Tailwind CSS to make things ✨ p r e t t y ✨
